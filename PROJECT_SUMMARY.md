# üìã Project Summary - Cloud Threat Detection Lab

## üéØ Project Overview

This Cloud Threat Detection & Incident Response lab demonstrates real-world AWS security automation using **GuardDuty**, **CloudWatch**, and **SNS**. It simulates a security incident scenario where a misconfigured EC2 instance is attacked, triggering an automated detection and alert workflow.

## üèóÔ∏è What's Included

### Infrastructure (Terraform)
- **VPC & Networking**: Complete VPC setup with public subnet
- **EC2 Instance**: Intentionally vulnerable target with open SSH
- **GuardDuty Detector**: Configured with all data sources
- **CloudWatch Events**: Rules to capture GuardDuty findings
- **SNS Topic**: Email alerts for security findings
- **Lambda Function**: Optional auto-remediation capability
- **IAM Roles**: Proper permissions for all services

### Automation Scripts
- **Deployment Script**: `scripts/deploy.sh` - Automated Terraform deployment
- **SSH Key Generator**: `scripts/generate_ssh_key.sh` - Creates SSH keys for the lab
- **Threat Simulator**: `scripts/test_threats.sh` - Simulates various attack vectors

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Comprehensive setup and usage guide
- **TESTING_GUIDE.md**: Detailed testing scenarios and troubleshooting
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams showing the complete flow

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Generate SSH keys
./scripts/generate_ssh_key.sh

# 2. Configure variables
cd infra
cp terraform.tfvars.template terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your email

# 3. Deploy infrastructure
../scripts/deploy.sh -i -a

# 4. Get target IP and test
terraform output instance_public_ip
../scripts/test_threats.sh <target-ip>
```
